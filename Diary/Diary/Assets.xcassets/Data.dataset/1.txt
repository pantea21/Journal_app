The Eiffel Tower peace symbol was designed by Jean Jullien, 32, a French illustrator living in London. “When I heard the news the first thing that came to mind was to draw a symbol of peace and solidarity for Paris. It was an immediate reaction, as a person rather than a professional. I drew this to show I was thinking about people in Paris,” Jullien told journalists afterwards.

“All I wanted was a strong symbol, something all the world could easily understand, and that all the world could share no matter where they were from … I wanted something universal.”

Gustave Eiffel’s 300-metre iron tower has always carried a message. It was constructed as the French national centrepiece for the 1889 Universal exhibition as a monument to industrial and cultural might. Having escaped demolition when the exhibition closed, as was planned, it remained the world’s tallest building for more than four decades.
